Rooted tree. Removing one branch - the left root child has been promoted to be the new root
The tips of the tree:givenTree were matched with the species names from the data as follows {3,0,2,1,4}

Pseudo-optimal path's cost 480 vs 612 for 1..k=> a 1.275 x improvement

If using full MST heurisitcs: 456 vs 612 for 1..k=> a 1.34211 x (relative 1.05263 x) improvement with 0 KB memory overhead
