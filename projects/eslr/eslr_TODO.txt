Project TODO list:
 [ ] Decide on a suitable alignment filtering method / cutoff.
 [X 2009-12-15] Re-connect with protein feature collection Java code.
     Note: I think the right thing to do here is to make the Java stuff input ONLY a sequence and accession, and output ONLY sequence-aligned features.
     Then we can plug into the database using the Perl module.
 [ ] Create two sets of GO enrichments: 1 for human GO assignments, 1 for mouse GO assignments
 [ ] Detailed comparisons to previously published work:
     [ ] Cherry-picked site-wise examples aligned to comparable published work.
     [ ] Sets of PSGs compared to, e.g. Kosiol, Nielsen, etc.
