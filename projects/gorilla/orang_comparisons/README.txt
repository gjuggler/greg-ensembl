This directory is a workspace for comparing our Ensembl gene sets to
the published Orangutan 1-to-1 ortholog set. Kosiol et al. used a
combination of refseq, vega, and ucsc transcripts to identify
orthologous groups.

What we should do to verify our results against theirs is the
following (tick off once done):

[ ] Convert Orangutan analysis IDs to ensembl gene IDs
[ ] Look at our top genes, see if they exist in Orangutan list
[ ] Look at top Orangutan genes, see if they exist in our list(s)

Easy, no?


NOTES
------

File 'geneset-masked-v2.txt' is not explicitly mentioned in the Orang
supplementary material, but I expect it's their dataset before
applying all the filters mentioned in the text.
