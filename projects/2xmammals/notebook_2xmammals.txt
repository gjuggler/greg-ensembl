Examples of experimental validation in mammals:
 - Sawyer et al. 2005 PNAS - Trim5alpha
   - http://www.pnas.org/content/102/8/2832.full
 - Ivarsson et al. 2002 J Biol Chem - Glutathione transferase
   - http://www.jbc.org/content/278/10/8733.full
 - Elde et al. 2009 Nature - Protein kinase R (pos-sel), eIF2 (no pos-sel)
   - Noted that other members of the same kinase family do not experience similar levels of
     pos-sel.
 - Gupta et al. 2009 PLoS Pathogens - Human Tetherin/BST-2/CD317
   - The gene has a single residue shift (at a pos-sel site)  that substantially impacts on
     sensitivity to HIV-1 Vpu.

Experimental validation elsewhere:
 - Bielawski et al. 2004 PNAS - proteorhodopsin - bacterial


Speculation without validation:
 - Wlasiuk et al. 2009 Mol Biol Evol - Toll-like recepfor 5 (TLR5)
 - Weadick and Chang 2009 Mol Biol Evol - BY Lens Crystallin (pretty crap)

Reviews / summaries:
 - Yang 2005 PNAS - The power of phylogenetic comparison in revealing protein function

# Nice quote from Bielawski et al. 2004:

Application of statistical methods has led to the discovery of many
genes evolving under positive selection, with the majority relating to
the immune response or sexual reproduction (20, 31). In such cases,
these genes are typically called .fast. genes, because the
evolutionary arms-race between host and parasite, or the evolutionary
forces associated with sexual competition or conflict, leads to rapid
evolution under diversifying selection. An alternative model exists
for .directional. evolution for altered function in a novel
environment; this model is strongly influenced by the extensive study
of adaptive alteration of oxygen affinity in vertebrate hemoglobins
(32, 33). Under the globin model, directional evolution proceeds by
rare adaptive modifications of the protein at one or very few key
positions, with all other substitutions being functionally neutral
(32, 33). Indeed, direct examination of functional change in response
to site-directed mutagenesis indicates that a large phenotypic change
can arise in a variety of proteins, including PRs, from just one or a
few amino acid changes (7, 30, 34). However, the results of
site-directed mutagenesis do not constitute a proof of a hypothesis of
natural selection. Observing a functional change in response to a
substitution by site-directed mutagenesis does not mean that if an
organism bore such a substitution it was subject to natural
selection. Likewise, the lack of a detectable effect from a
substitution is not proof that such a change did not have fitness
consequences in the natural environment. All one can do is evaluate
and refine a hypothesis about patterns and mechanisms of adaptive
molecular evolution in light of all of the available evidence. In the
case of PRs, the combination of phylogeny-based statistical analysis
and site-directed mutagenesis suggested that substitutions with small
or no measurable effect on absorption maxima might have had important
fitness consequences in the oceanic environment. Although we suspect
that much evolutionary change in proteins such as PRs is indeed
neutral, we argue that the globin model for directional evolution,
i.e., assuming that changes at other than the major-effect sites are
selectively neutral (32, 33), should be treated cautiously.
