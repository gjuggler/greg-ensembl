Started project.

Thinking of which sets of simulations to run.

Trees:
1) Vertebrates - typical Ensembl-like tree
 - ~50 species
 - branch length: XYZ
2) Eutherian - typical Ensembl-like tree, with only eutherian mammals
 - ~29 species
 - branch length: XYZ
3) Primate - primate sub-tree, ~8 species, short branch length
4) B-globin - 18-taxa tree from Anisimova study
5) Artificial - 6-taxon artificial tree from Anisimova, Massingham

Omega distributions:
1) Lognormal: randomly drawn from a lognormal (meanlog=-4.079, sdlog=2.863)
2) Gamma: randomly drawn from a gamma (shape=0.271, rate=1.203)

Indel processes:
1) None.
2) Low frequency, random
3) Hi frequency, random
4) Hi frequency, correlated with omegas.

Meeting with Nick. Main points covered:

1) Keep the simulations simple.

TREES:
 - 6-taxon tree from Anisimova and Yang studies
 - ENCODE species tree
 - Vary total branch length to match up with Anisimova studies

ALIGNMENT SIM:
 - 1:1 in/del ratio
 - 1:10 indel/subst. ratio
 - Very short exponential distribution. Mostly 3, some 6, a few 9-base indels.

OMEGA SIM:
 - M3,M7 and M8 parameters to match Anisimova studies (at least to start with)

ALIGNERS:
 - ClustalW
 - MCoffee
 - Prank (codon? back-tx protein?)

FILTERING STEPS:
 - Gblocks
 - TrimAl
 - Prank post-filtering

2) For the analysis, use one reference sequence (for Encode tree, try 2: human and one with a longer preceding branch)
and look at the amount of false positives & negatives

3) Discussed some things about the splitting up / modeling of genes with and without pos-sel.

One option would be to try and infer the parameters for a combination of two distributions. Either:
 - Two lognormal/gamma/whatever distributions, one with cutoff below 1 and one allowing sites above 1.
 - One M7 distribution, one M8 distribution
