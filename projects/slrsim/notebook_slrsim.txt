Thinking of which sets of simulations to run.

Trees:
1) Vertebrates - typical Ensembl-like tree
 - ~50 species
 - branch length: XYZ
2) Eutherian - typical Ensembl-like tree, with only eutherian mammals
 - ~29 species
 - branch length: XYZ
3) Primate - primate sub-tree, ~8 species, short branch length
4) B-globin - 18-taxa tree from Anisimova study
5) Artificial - 6-taxon artificial tree from Anisimova, Massingham

Omega distributions:
1) Lognormal: randomly drawn from a lognormal (meanlog=-4.079, sdlog=2.863)
2) Gamma: randomly drawn from a gamma (shape=0.271, rate=1.203)

Indel processes:
1) None.
2) Low frequency, random
3) Hi frequency, random
4) Hi frequency, correlated with omegas.
