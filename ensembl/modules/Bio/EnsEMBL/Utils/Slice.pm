=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Slice - Utility functions for slices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Slice qw(split_Slices);

  ...

  # get all chromosomes in the database
  my $slices = $slice_adaptor->fetch_all('chromosome');

  # split the chromosomes into equal chunks of size less than 1MB
  # with an overlap of 1kb
  $slices = split_Slices($slices, 1e6, 1e3);

=head2 split_Slices

  Arg [1]    : ref to list of slices
  Arg [2]    : int maxlength of sub slices
  Arg [3]    : int overlap length (optional)
  Example    : my $sub_slices = split_Slices($slices,$maxlen,$overlap)
  Description: splits a slice into smaller slices 
  Returntype : ref to list of slices
  Exceptions : maxlen <1 or overlap < 0
